## General information
This is a 5x5 tic-tac-toe. Two players will take turn to draw their mark on the grid. In order to win, the player has to place four marks on the same row (vertical/ horizontal/ diagonal). 

## What's unique about this Tic-Tac-Toe? 
Instead of defining each player as usual X or O, the game defines each player as the image of BTS members.
